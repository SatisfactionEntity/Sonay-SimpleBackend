To make sure you got the previous versions of this habbo cms the not-editted versions, 
i will be only give the website backend it self. This does not include the following folders.

- AvatarGenerator 
- htdocs 
- Some more important stuff.

This is because of people who think they can ez search stuff and think they can re-name the credits in the footer
after they found what they were looking for.

Converting this SWF client into HTML5 client (Since flash stopped) would not be hard.

I will not explain this, since hotel developers can do it by them self right?

Goodluck!
